# NEXUS ACCESS TERMINAL

A multi-realm interactive field device built for immersive park experiences.

This repository powers NFC-triggered digital artifacts designed for:

- **Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance**
- **Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind**
- **TRON Lightcycle / Run**

Each artifact contains an NFC chip that links to a unique GitHub Pages endpoint.  
Scanning the artifact initiates an in-universe terminal sequence themed to the ride.

## 🎭 Experience Design Philosophy

The goal is to create:

- Short, immersive interactions
- Playful cast member engagement
- NFC-triggered story beats
- Thematic continuity across franchises

The system functions as a fictional cross-realm access console — a courier device capable of interfacing with multiple worlds.
